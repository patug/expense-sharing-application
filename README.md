# Expense Sharing Application (Splitwise-like Backend)

This project is a simplified **Expense Sharing Application** inspired by Splitwise.  
It focuses on designing a **clean backend system** that supports expense splitting,
balance tracking, simplified settlements, and clear API-driven interactions.

The goal is correctness, clarity, and explainability rather than UI or infrastructure complexity.
